I am currently studying in Kyunghee University as an undergraduate, and I plan to graduate in February 2022. I am always interested in what a good product is and what people want, and I think that development or research should proceed based on this thought. I am in the position of both AI Research and Engineer, but I would like research and engineering based on product.

Also, I am very interested in open source and development collaboration culture. As a good product and open source project, I would like to list my name on [BDFL(Benevolent Dictator for Life)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life). And I hope my project can have a lot of impact on society and culture like Linux, Redis and Ethereum projects. Therefore, I consider ['One person's open source can lead new market with new technology'](https://github.com/graykode) as the motto.

I am not afraid to grow up and I think I have to go out into a bigger well to see a wider market and view. Therefore, I value the industry experience. If your company want to grow with me, please contact me by [email](mailto:nlkey2022@gmail.com).
