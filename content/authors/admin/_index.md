I'm an undergraduate student at Kyunghee University majoring in Computer Engineering, expected to graduate in February 2022. 
Two sets of work have defined my career interests: Research in NLP and AI Engineering.

**Research in NLP**  
As an AI research engineer, My research has focused on Language Modeling to make a more smart AI model. Specifically, I am interested in building a language model to solve a real-world problem: (1) developing an efficient language model through model light-weighting such as knowledge distillation or augmented memory in the model. (2) Programming language NLP which can help people write code, docstring and commit message. I have the following views regarding research: Research should be based on service products. And transferring from the only R & D to a service product is an essential ability for AI researchers.

**AI Engineering**  
As the model gets bigger, engineering's ability to manage many GPU machines is essential for training. Since I have the industry experience to deal with many GPU machines, I deeply understand how to handle many multi-node GPU with avoiding bottlenecks. I also managed data pipelines efficiently (See my open source project: [matorage](https://matorage.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)!) and designed scalable cloud infrastructure to service trained models.
