[{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"I am currently studying in Kyunghee University as an undergraduate, and I plan to graduate in February 2022. I am always interested in what a good product is and what people want, and I think that development or research should proceed based on this thought. I am in the position of both AI Research and Engineer, but I would like research and engineering based on product.\nAlso, I am very interested in open source and development collaboration culture. As a good product and open source project, I would like to list my name on BDFL(Benevolent Dictator for Life). And I hope my project can have a lot of impact on society and culture like Linux, Redis and Ethereum projects. Therefore, I consider \u0026lsquo;One person\u0026rsquo;s open source can lead new market with new technology\u0026rsquo; as the motto.\nI am not afraid to grow up and I think I have to go out into a bigger well to see a wider market and view. Therefore, I value the industry experience. If your company want to grow with me, please contact me by email.\n Download my resum√©. -- ","date":1601856000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1601856000,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"","section":"authors","summary":"I am currently studying in Kyunghee University as an undergraduate, and I plan to graduate in February 2022.
