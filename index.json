Two sets of work have defined my career interests: Research in NLP and AI Engineering.\nResearch in NLP\nAs an AI research engineer, My research has focused on Language Modeling to make a more smart AI model. Specifically, I am interested in building a language model to solve a real-world problem: (1) developing an efficient language model through model light-weighting such as knowledge distillation or augmented memory in the model. (2) Programming language NLP which can help people write code, docstring and commit message. I have the following views regarding research: Research should be based on service products. And transferring from the only R \u0026amp; D to a service product is an essential ability for AI researchers.\nAI Engineering\nAs the model gets bigger, engineering\u0026rsquo;s ability to manage many GPU machines is essential for training. Since I have the industry experience to deal with many GPU machines, I deeply understand how to handle many multi-node GPU with avoiding bottlenecks. I also managed data pipelines efficiently (See my open source project: matorage!) and designed scalable cloud infrastructure to service trained models.\n Download my resum√©. -- ","date":1622246400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1622246400,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"","section":"authors","summary":"I\u0026rsquo;m an undergraduate student at Kyunghee University majoring in Computer Engineering, expected to graduate in February 2022.
